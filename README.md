# explorer
Simple web game based on Orteil's Nested

Old project made back in 2015. The plan was to make a large procedural world represented through vector graphics. We stopped this project because we couldn't figure out a good game loop.

Fun fact: [The Startup Generator](http://tiffzhang.com/startup) was originally created to be an easter egg in "Explorer".
